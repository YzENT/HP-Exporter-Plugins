# NFSHPR Exporter Plugins

This plugin is made to ease the process of exporting models for the game Need for Speedâ„¢ Hot Pursuit Remastered


### Prerequisites

- [Blender (v3.6)](https://www.blender.org/download/releases/3-6/)

### Installation

Head to `Edit > Preferences > Addons > Install` and install the zip file under releases without unzipping.

### Functions

- Vehicle
	- Preparing Collection
		- This creates a scene collection for the vehicle you wish to export for, while importing all the default textures used in `VEHICLETEX.BIN`.
		
    - Assigning empties
    	- This assigns the required transformation for the empties for each available mesh in the scene. Note that only the selected meshes will be assigned a parent.

	- Material Template
		- This is a collection of material templates with pre-tuned values to assign materials easier. Image nodes under shader editor will be created for each material depending on what type of textures they use. Please refer to `Extras\Basic Vehicle Shader Documentation.pdf` to check what each layer of UV each texture is on.
